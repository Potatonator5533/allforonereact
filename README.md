//All For One React Rebuild
//A rebuild of a previous assignment, All for One, which is rebuilt in React.
//Peer Name: Avery Hillstrom
//Peer Review: All of the pages work as intended, and the webpage is nicely formatted and visually pleasing. Program has data validation, as the response does not appear if one of the inputs is empty except in the case of the number-only endpoints, where the program takes in the empty inputs as zeroes. For the number-only inputs, the response also does not appear if non-numerical inputs are entered. The only issue I could find is there is a bit of a responsiveness issue with the navbar in mobile sizes- there is a floating hamburger icon that doesn't have any functionality, and the navbar text and dropdown button go outside of the grey containing div/navbar. Overall, a very well functioning react app!
